## Intro

First post here. I'm going to be using this blog to document my daily accomplishments.
Inspired by [this design plan on Medium](https://designyear.com/), I'm going to do a little
thing of my own for as long as I can and to keep myself accountable. Logging down things
is a great way to keep yourself thinking about how to best carry out your day too.

## The Daily Challenge (for a month)

Picked up [You Can Draw in 30 Days](https://www.amazon.com/You-Can-Draw-30-Days-ebook/dp/B004MYFV0O/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1)
today in my mailbox, and to retain my habit, I'm going to post each drawing every day. Well, maybe
not everyday :). At least once a week though, I'll come back to reflect on my results.

Here's to day 1:
