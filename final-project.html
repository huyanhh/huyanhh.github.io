        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <h3>User Interviews</h3>
        <p>User interviews helped me figure out what kind of other candidates expect in
        their portfolios. Perhaps there were additional problems that would have gone
            undiscovered if I had not asked other students. The main questions that
            helped me understand were questions about features and expectations.</p>

        <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
        <p>Competitor analysis is good to get a sense of the strengths in weaknesses in the portfolios
            of other people competing against you. I reviewed two students from different universities
            who had jobs working at Uber and Airbnb, and then I reviewed an online portfolio repository.
            These are all competitors who had overall stronger portfolios than I did, so I wanted to see
            where I can improve in terms of their weaknesses.
        </p>

        <h3>Feature Value Matrix</h3>
        <p>A feature value matrix allows you to inspect each feature and weigh how much value it brings
            to your overall product. I weighed the 8 most important features of my site. Completing the
            matrix allowed me to deselect features that I was initially biased in and focus on the more
            important ones.
        </p>

        </a>
        <h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>
        <p>Using the feature value matrix, I was able to place the features that I needed to ship as
            quick as possible onto an organized timeline. If I go from right to left, even if I don't
            get all of them done by a deadline, the more necessary features will be complete.
        </p>

        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <h3>User Stories</h3>
        <p> User stories helped me understand what the users need. It serves as a checkpoint to see
            if I have the right features in mind before I build them. After doing user stories I was
            able to evaluate if I have all the features that I wanted.
        </p>

        <h3>Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>
        <p> For the cognitive walkthrough I went through the actual website with users and observed how
            they react to each instruction that I give. I used the user stories as my hypothesis and
            tested it with my users. Sometimes users did not give any information, and others gave too
            much unrelated information. Overall these revealed the actual problems I have with my site.
        </p>

        </a>
        <h3>User Test</h3>
        <p> I conducted a click test and a preview test. The preview test was a 5 second examination to
            see if the website were interesting enough to move forward, since the first impressions are
            usually made within the first 5-10 seconds of seeing something new. The other test was done to
            see where users clicked for information. Test results were mainly uniform for the preview. The
            click test had results all over the place, however.

        <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
        <p>
            When doing user research, I hypothesized that the projects section was the most important part
            of the portfolio. That section was the one that stood out to me the most when I was doing the
            competitor analysis and feature prioritization. I did not find the same in my user interviews,
            however. The users whom I interviewed focused more on the personal aspect of the portfolio. I found
            that there was a dissonance between these two types of findings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keeping my hypothesis in mind, I found that with other users who are students generally
            commented about the overall aesthetic of the website more so than the features themselves.
            When I did the tests with the users, they pointed out things that did not have to do with
            the work that I wanted to present. There were also usability problems with the mobile versions
            of the website that I showed them.
        </p>
        <h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>
        <p>
            Since it is evident that I need to first improve the emotional response of my website, I need
            to do some research first in graphic design then emotional design. I also need to fix the visual
            bugs that I didn't realize would be a problem when I was building the site. The mobile menu
            needs to be adjusted a little for people who usually make their windows smaller, although that
            is a problem that came up only occasionally. Afterwards, I should test it again with the same
            users and see if they can find usability issues associated with the presentation of the
            actual projects, which is what the types of users look for on a portfolio site.
