      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>
        This was my project for my Project in Human Computer Interaction class at UC Irvine.
        Working with the UCI Graduate Program in Network Systems, we were asked to build a user facing web application
        that takes in data from exercise bike machines and displays it in a meaningful way to doctors and trainers who
        are
        treating patients recovering from leukemia.
      </p>
      <img class="img-responsive" src="./assets/img/portfolio/ix/1.png" alt="">
      <h4>The Process</h4>
      <p>
        Based on the what the client wanted the web application to do, we created rough flow sketches of how the pages
        would go from flow depending on which user has logged in to the application. The main functions that we focused
        on were adding patients, removing patients, and viewing patient statistics in the system.
      </p>
      <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="assets/img/portfolio/ix/2.png" alt="">
      <p>
        Along with my team, I conducted interviews and figured out what to build, then tested the wireframes with
        the stakeholders. The sketches that we tested with the client were validated, so we turned that into an HTML
        Bootstrap prototype.
        <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="assets/img/portfolio/ix/2.5.png" alt="">
      </p>
      <h4>UX Methods</h4>
      <p>
        The next step was testing it with the actual users. The client was only an intermediary, so we needed to go to
        doctors and trainers
        to see if the website was usable. A major hurdle, however, was the time constraints of the doctors and the scope
        of the class.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each type of user, we created a list of tasks to perform on the static website. We asked doctors
        to add and remove a patient from the system, and asked trainers to view patient information. After the users
        would finish each task assigned to them, they would answer a survey asking them how difficult it was to perform
        each task.
      </p>
      <p>
        We used Google forms to create the surveys and emailed the links to our user representative, who then emailed
        the doctors and trainers all of the materials. The survey consisted of mainly closed questions but had
        two open questions. Because we were not able to directly interview the customers, the closed ended questions
        were better
        to get responses and were able to be analyzed directly in Google forms.
      </p>

      <h4>Development</h4>
      <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="assets/img/portfolio/ix/4.png" alt="">
      <p>
        Once we learned the exact details of a successful product we built the application. The client wanted us to use
        MongoDB for the database and Java for the backend, but we decided that Node.js would be a better fit because of
        existing APIs. We created a server that would run the HTML pages and manage web socket messages to the web
        client.
        To connect with the exercise bikes, we used the RabbitMQ message broker to send statistics such as heart rate,
        mileage, and calories burned to the MongoDB database.
      </p>
      <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="assets/img/portfolio/ix/5.png" alt="">
      <p>
        I was in charge of writing to the database and making sure the data incoming from the server were integrity
        checked in MongoDB using Mongoose. It is important that when a doctor or trainer enters data on the main
        interface, badly formatted data will be rejected. We successfully finished the application within 5 weeks.
      </p>
      <h4>Challenges</h4>
      <p>
        Without direct contact with the users, it is difficult to do any sort of research that involves usability
        testing.
        Since the time frame was small for a class project, we had to make a lot of assumptions. Also, have an
        intermediary
        slows down the process by a lot because of the back and forth communication. In the end, however, we learned a
        lot about how to conduct user research and about the pitfalls of certain methods.
